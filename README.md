# Ask-me-Weather

### Ask me Weather!, Its an ultimate weather app that I have build by fetching data from API call and fetures developed by Javascript.

This allows user to get weather data of their live location as well as manually entered city's weather Information in case if the device doesn't supports the geoLocation track.

API source creadit: https://openweathermap.org/current

<b>Key features of the project:</b></br>
-> switching tabs between current location and particular city</br>
-> user's city name and country logo</br>
-> atmosphere's brief information with temperature value</br>
-> dynamic temperature units converter option among kel,°C and °F.</br>
-> wind speed, humidity and cloud data</br>
-> fully responsive as per mobile first development approach</br>
